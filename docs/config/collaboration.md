# Collaboration

Multi-person collaboration means that multiple users **simultaneously** edit the same document, and users can see each other's document operations, including writing, deleting, modifying text content, inserting pictures, etc.

At the same time, you can see other users' nicknames, focus location and other information.

> PS: This feature is only available in the Pro version , not in the open source version. Pro version preview address: http://aieditor-pro.jpress.cn

## How to use

```typescript
new AiEditor({
    element: "#aiEditor",
    collaboration: {
        url: "ws://127.0.0.1:8080?somekey=value",
        documentName: "my document",
        token: "your-token",
        userName: "Michael Yang",
        userColor: "#abcdef",
        onAuthenticated: () => {
        },
        onAuthenticationFailed: (reason: string) => {
        },
        onUsersUpdate: (users: any[]) => {
        },
